        Think of the Earth as the NBA’s ultimate franchise player—a true MVP who
        does everything on the court. It’s got elite defense with its atmosphere
        blocking harmful radiation, strong rebounding with gravity keeping
        oceans and air locked in, and unmatched playmaking by supporting life in
        every form. Earth runs the offense of the solar system like a seasoned
        point guard, rotating consistently, setting the pace with day and night,
        and controlling the flow of seasons like a coach drawing up the perfect
        game plan. Every ecosystem is a different role player, and together they
        form a deep, championship-caliber roster that’s been competing at the
        highest level for billions of years.

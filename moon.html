    <h1>Moon</h1>
    <!-- GPT 5.2 "give me a paragraph or two general description of the 
    earth and the moon except I want them in nba terms" -->
    <p>
      The Moon is Earth’s most reliable teammate—the lockdown defender and
      veteran presence who doesn’t always show up on the stat sheet but changes
      the game. It sets hard screens by stabilizing Earth’s tilt, controls the
      boards by managing the tides, and keeps the tempo steady so the whole
      system doesn’t fall apart. The Moon may not score much, but it’s always in
      the right position, circling Earth like a trusted sixth man who knows
      their role perfectly. Without the Moon, Earth’s championship run would be
      way more chaotic—proof that even the greatest superstar needs the right
      supporting cast to win it all.

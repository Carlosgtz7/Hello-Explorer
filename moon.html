        The Moon is Earth’s most reliable teammate—the lockdown defender and
        veteran presence who doesn’t always show up on the stat sheet but
        changes the game. It sets hard screens by stabilizing Earth’s tilt,
        controls the boards by managing the tides, and keeps the tempo steady so
        the whole system doesn’t fall apart. The Moon may not score much, but
        it’s always in the right position, circling Earth like a trusted sixth
        man who knows their role perfectly. Without the Moon, Earth’s
        championship run would be way more chaotic—proof that even the greatest
        superstar needs the right supporting cast to win it all.
